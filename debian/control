Description: parallelism library for C++ - development files
 TBB is a library that helps you leverage multi-core processor
 performance without having to be a threading expert. It represents a
 higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts platform details
 and threading mechanism for performance and scalability.
 .
 (Note: if you are a user of the i386 architecture, i.e., 32-bit Intel
 or compatible hardware, this package only supports Pentium4-compatible
 and higher processors.)
 .
 This package includes the TBB development files.
